# Mission to Mars Website

## Purpose
We are assisting Robin in creating a working website application that contains information for Mars that can help gain the attention of NASA. In order to impress and showcase her knowledge, she has asked for assistance in creating an application that contains a table of facts for Mars, featured images, and articles pertaining to Mars. We assist in creating a button that when ‘clicked’ scrapes the data to produce the latest results, always maintaining the site up to date.

As we have the foundation of the site, we are looking to add additional images of Mars’ hemispheres to the site to encompass more of the planet’s information. Essentially, we are putting the knowledge of scraping text and images from one site to transcribe and produce the visual output of them on our Mars made website. By utilizing a number of coding tools (Python, Jupyter Notebook, MongoDB, and HTML), we are able to improve the web application to display the new data and alter the design to create a more visually appealing site that will surely garner the attention of NASA . 

## Tech Used:
- HTML
- MongoDB
- CSS
- Flask

## Objectives:
- Gain familiarity with and use HTML elements, as well as class and id attributes, to identify content for web scraping.
- Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape.
- Create a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
- Create a web application with Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
- Create an HTML/CSS portfolio to showcase projects.
- Use Bootstrap components to polish and customize the portfolio.

## Results
Through the use of HTML and CSS, we have established a functional site for Robin that displays updated and real-time articles and photos of Mars to catch the eye of Nasa. Web scraping proved to be a powerful method for the data visualization of Mars and essentially the building blocks for all websites.
