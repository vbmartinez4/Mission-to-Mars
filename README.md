# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose

The main goal at the creation of this project was to assist Robin in creating a function application that contains information for Mars that can help gain the attention of NASA. In order to impress and showcase her knowledge, she asked for assistance in creating an application that contains a table of facts for Mars, featured images, and articles pertaining to Mars. We assist in creating a button that when ‘clicked’ scrapes the data to produce the latest results, always maintaining the site up to date.

As we have the foundation of the site, we are looking to add additional images of Mars’s hemispheres to the site to encompass more of the planet’s information. Essentially, we are putting the knowledge of scraping text and images from one site to transcribe and produce the visual output of them on our Mars made website. By utilizing a number of coding tools (Python, Jupyter Notebook, MongoDB, and HTML), we are able to improve the web application to display the new data and alter the design to create a more visually appealing site that will surely garner the attention of NASA .
